1. Slowfetch is terminal cli program that prints out system information such as the hardware configuration, software environment and a logo drawn in ascii art.

2. Focus on execution speed and readability of code.

3. From the start, create induvidual functions for each component of the fetch program. Example: The box drawing elements are all handled by one function, ascii and art drawing is handled by its own function.

4. Employ the use of the concept of "content".
    4a. Content is anything thing within a drawn box. Example: Center the "content" vertically and horizontally within the fetch output box which contains inforamtion.
    4b. When prepairing content for render, induvidual parts of the content should be sepperated for ease of modification. 

5. A fetch output line is infomation from functions in the modules file.
   Each induvidual output should have an either an identifying name or ghlyph describing what information is on that line followed by a sepperator.
   Example fetch output line featureing an indentifying name, a sepporator and then the information: CPU ~ AMD Ryzen 9 9950x 

6. Always check current terminal width and height and change to preset layouts to adapt to size constraints.
